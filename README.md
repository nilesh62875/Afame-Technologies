In this repository i have created a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, where i have implemented an 
interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
The calculator has a display screen to show user input and results. I have Utilized CSS grid system
for button alignments. Used event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops to handle user
input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be done with basic
knowledge of these technologies..
